# GraphChain PoC: Mammoth

This repository contains code for Mammoth, an implementation of the blockchain technology enhanced by the Semantic Web 
technology.  It is intended to be a PoC that shows how to connect both technology in a way that enables us to take an 
advantage of both worlds.

For now, you can send a RDF graph by the HTTP endpoint and it will be persisted in a repository together with a block's 
header.  There is also a way to verify whole chain.

More information can be find in the documentation.
